Therefore, it is important to help people in the earthquake area to make their lives easier both today and in the future. </br> </br> It can be used as a platform for helping people. While it is possible to follow your social media, Github and Discord accounts for now, the website we will open soon will allow you to reach even more people and discuss help issues in more detail. </br> </br> People like you, organizations that aim to help more than earthquake victims are important for the future of society. We will contribute to the coming together of many people and organizations acting for this purpose and rushing to the aid of earthquake victims.",
